<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<h2>Basketball</h2>
<p>One of my main hobbies is and always was basketball. I love playing sports, I love being in a team and I like 
    the competitive feeling that I get when I play an official game. It stretches my body, my mind, my nerves, but it
    relaxes my soul.

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
    Another hobby that I invest a lot of time in is music. I am vocalist, drummer and guitarist, and I love creating and interpreting music.
    I've been dedicating time and resources in this hobby for some years now, and I've been playing in my church's band for a year and a half now.
    Music captures a part of me that I wouldn't be able to express otherwise.

<h2>Games</h2>
<p>When I have free time I enjoy spending my time on relaxing video games. I like the immersion feeling that I get when I play a good game,
    and I love getting emotionally connected with the world created, it's like reading a book or watching a good movie.
